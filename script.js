Your pink sweater is an outfit that I find to be my favorite and it is soley because of this. I remember coming home from this date and thinking to myself that about how beautiful of a girl you are and how wonderful I am to have a girlfriend like you. I loved getting to know you, even if it was a bit awkward for the first time. One of the things I laugh about most for this date is the dilemma we gave the waiter when trying to pay. Whenever I think of us, I think of this first. There has not been point where I thought about the past with you and neglected this memory. This is something that I will forever remember. ",

I honestly don't think I've ever seen you in shorts until that date so that was something new. My favorite part of Keyport honestly is being in a public place that feels so private. There is a lot of activity around us, but when we want we can sink into our own world and just enjoy each other's presence. I loved doing this up and down the boardwalk or even walking into the restaurants. Which by the way I remember picking a restaurant was pretty hard because both of us were quite indecisive!!

It was so crowded, but we also had the ability to sink into our own worlds. I remember being on a towel and staring into each other.

I learned a lot about your fashion sense (even if I don't really understand it still). I enjoyed teasing you about random clothing items that you should've tried on. I enjoyed getting matching mango boba tea and also being able to sit down and eat Chick-Fil-A with you. It seems pretty basic, but I love eating with you.

The way you laughed and checked in on me to make sure I was doing alright was so cute, and I could never forget that face. You also made me not get Chick-Fil-A which was also good because I got some very good pizza instead!! OH and I remember that one lady asking if you were my girlfriend and saying that I should try to win you something, quickly followed by her son letting out remarks of disapproval to her. Looking back, I probably should've taken her up on the offer. One thing I did feel bad about was getting kicked out of the ride because I was leaning on the fence. However, I am happy that we were able to go on it at least once. My favorite part though was our moments where we'd be on the ferris wheel. I remember that time you gave a girl a lollipop and honestly it was so kind, it became attractive. I've always loved your kindess towards others and this was just another display of that.",

I loved walking down to Starbucks as it meant that I got to have your hand in mine as we walked down the streets my mother though I'd die on. I'm so happy you decided to build the lego flowers together, it was just so significant and changed the way I view LEGO forever. I can never think of a set without thinking about this day. ALSO I wanted to kiss you so badly, you were so kissable that day but I chickend out, which I really wish I didn't. When I opened all your gifts I was so stunned.

I also felt really bad about that fake smiski so I decided to get you a new one and those naked boy stickers. I hope you enjoy them (although I still think the naked boy stickers are weird for modelling the parts!!).",

        text: "This mall date was also something that stood out a lot. We spent most of our time painting plates at Color Me Mine. This was something that you've wanted to do forever so I'm happy that we finally got the chance to do it. Seeing you paint was so fun because you have this specific face when your very focused on something. Your lips get narrower and wider as you pull them in and your face gets more concentrated. It's honestly really cute. However, what I love most about this date is that I can now use a plate daily and be reminded of the joys in our relationship. I really love my Elmer plate (even though I'm stil jealous of him) and eating the smores on them when Valentine's day came was really warming to me.",

I remember the shock on your face when you actually saw the flowers and the way we took a million photos with them. I still love looking through these photos today. Then we hugged a bit your bed. I really enjoy when we do that beacuse I get to deeply admire the girl I love, which is one of my favorite activites. You have so much qualities to admire such as your dedication, your intelligence, your comforting skills, your ability to love, and your draw-droppping looks. The drive to the restaurant with your dad was also fun as we got to take a ton of cute photos. THAT ONE PHOTO WITH THE GLASSES AND THE TAPE is forever etched into my mind. There is just something about that photo that I cannot pinpoint. These photos continued into dinner time and it was such a highlight of the day. I genuinely love going through these photos so much. When I opened my gift at your house I was stunned. The moving card you made me is something I use oftently whenever I miss you. I loved the way the s'mores tasted and the care you put into making those candy flowers. I still have the flower sticks and bear in my room to be remninded of such an important milestone where we both felt so happy.",

        text: "This anniversary has been such a rollercoaster of emotions. There was so much new information dropping that I felt like my entire world was collapsing. However, as we talked through text and worked it out, I got more relieved each time. I honestly don't think we could've had a better one year. From the moment I went to your room I could feel all my worry vanish away. The only thing that mattered was that I was with you. We showed each other our gifts and I was so stunned with what you made me. I fully did not expect anything because of the timeframe you told me you lost feelings, but I'm so happy that I got something. There is nothing more priceless than a gift that recounts all our greatest memories. I walked by that picture frame so many times today and each time I paused and admired how far we came. I've scrolled through the memory book time and time again as well as the photos we took on that day and I could not believe how much you've changed. You genuinely have become so much prettier, but you've also changed a lot as a person. Over the past year I've gotten to see you become a bit more confident in your academic abilities, drink a ton more water, and take on challenges that you thought you couldn't handle. I am forever proud of you and I love you so so much. Going to dinner was like being hit by a nostalgia train. The minute I walked in the door all the memories of the first date hit me so hard. It felt like a reset to our relationship and I think it played a large role in helping us get through that conflict we had. When we went back to your house, YOU GAVE ME THE CUTEST HUG EVER. The way you ran to give me a hug immediately after closing the door was probably the cutest thing I've ever seen you do. I love the moments where it was just you and me and we were able to spend all that time in each other's arms. I came home from that date being free from all my worries. I'm so grateful for this past year with you and I really look forward to the next one.",
